Reinforcement learning algorithms for spiking networks and artificial neural networks.

## Currently implemented

1. Deep deterministic policy gradients with hindsight experience replay
2. Stochastic policy gradient with hindsight experience replay
3. Hindsight policy gradient with a biased policy gradient estimator

## In progress...

1. Distributed proximal policy optimization
